# Vivecraft-autolauncher
It's a simple AutoHotKey script which launches the Minecraft Launcher and automatically clicks on the Play button. 

#####You need to have Minecraft installed in the default location (%Appdata%\.minecraft) for this to work.

#####If you have other profiles than Vivecraft one (for example for your normal Minecraft) you need to launch Vivecraft profile once, that way it will automatically be selected when you start your Minecraft launcher.

It helps running the game directly from the SteamVR without taking the Vive headset off.

It's one of my first AutoHotKey scripts so there are probably some unnecessary lines and other stuff.

It should work like this:

1. Launches the Minecraft launcher through command line

2. Waits 3 seconds

3. Clicks on the 450, 542 location where the Play Button should be.

#####Please write in the [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/4pxqxj/ive_made_a_vivecraft_launcher_for_launching_it/) if this works for you or not, thank you!


TO-DO: I need to clean the script of the unnecessary, not working lines. Right now it works but the code is really bad. I don't even know why I have some lines there.
