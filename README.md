# Vivecraft-autolauncher
It's a simple AutoHotKey script which launches the Minecraft Launcher and automatically clicks on the Play button. 

You need to have Minecraft installed in the default location (%Appdata%\.minecraft) for this to work.

It helps running the game directly from the SteamVR without taking the Vive headset off.

It's one of my first AutoHotKey scripts so there are probably some unnecessary lines and other stuff.

It should work like this:

1. Launches the Minecraft launcher through command line

2. Waits 3 seconds

3. Clicks on the 450, 542 location where the Play Button should be.


TO-DO: I need to clean the script of the unnecessary, not working lines. Right now it works but the code is really bad. I don't even know why I have some lines there.
