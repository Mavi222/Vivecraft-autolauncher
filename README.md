# Vivecraft-autolauncher
It's a simple AutoHotKey script which launches the Minecraft Launcher and automatically clicks on the Play button. 

At the first launch of the program, it will ask you where your Minecraft launcher is located.

It helps running the game directly from the SteamVR without taking the Vive headset off.

It's one of my first AutoHotKey scripts so there are probably some unnecessary lines and other stuff.

It should work like this:

1. Launches the Minecraft launcher through command line

2. Waits 4 seconds

3. Clicks in the middle of the window, -64 pixels from the bottom, where the Play Button should be.

TO-DO: I need to clean the script of the unnecessary, not working lines. Right now it works but the code is really bad.
       I also could make the script to ask you if you use the new or the old launcher so it's backwards compatible.
