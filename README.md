# Vivecraft-autolauncher
It's a simple AutoHotKey script which launches the Minecraft Launcher and automatically clicks on the Play button. 
It helps running the game directly from the SteamVR without taking the Vive headset off.
It's one of my first AutoHotKey scripts so there are probably some unnecessary lines and other stuff.
You need to have Minecraft installed in the default location (%Appdata%\.minecraft) for this to work.
It should work like this:
1. Launches the Minecraft launcher
2. Waits 3 seconds
3. Clicks on the 450, 542 location where the Play Button should be.
